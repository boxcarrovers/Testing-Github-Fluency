# Testing Github Fluency
This is to understand better how repos and git work


I am making this commit on the public version.  

Into the mystic. 
Not sure why the Counting Crows from Github desktop did not make it in. 

I'm changing this again. 

A few more notes:
  1.  you can upload files directly from local drive.
  2.  a word file doesn't automatically get translated.  so this is primarily looking for code in basic / notepad level complexity.
  3.  This makes me want to understand the markup system and whether a particular IDE (integrated development environment) matters or if they're all good enough.
  4.  an email with pics --- the pics don't make it through.
  5.  This will have implications likely in how we upload the manuals.

  6.
